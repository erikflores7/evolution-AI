# evolution-AI
  I wanted to experiment with learning AI so I made this program to experiment with evolution/AI.

  Little circle begins without much intelligence and moves randomly. Upon colliding with an object, the circle dies but creates
a new circle that is smarter and remembers what caused the previous death. With more deaths and more generations, it becomes smarter
 and could prevent dying and reaching the end.

 At a certain level of intelligence, movement is upgraded and randomness is greatly reduced and instead movement is based on what gets
 the circle closer to the end location.

 Fusion is a mutation that can be attained and happens when 2 circles that can fuse collide, most traits are either the first or second's
 but some are added together

   TODO:
* Add menu and ability to change starting settings
* Make sure spawn does not already have a block of death/survival
* Add chance for going extinct and losing if dying before reproducing or something similar
* Add better random generation of landscape
* Make sure size doesn't affect death memory, Eg. Being smaller might allow movement through places where before would cause death
