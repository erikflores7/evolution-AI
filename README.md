# evolution-AI
  I wanted to experiment with learning AI so I made this program to experiment with evolution/AI.

  Little circle begins without much intelligence and moves randomly. Upon colliding with an object, the circle dies but creates
a new circle that is smarter and remembers what caused the previous death. With more deaths and more generations, it becomes smarter
 and could prevent dying and reaching the end.

    Added Mutation's to the circle's "genes" (Size, Reproduction Rate, Mutation Rate, etc.) and Duplication/Splitting of the
    parent circle that remembers their deaths as well

   TODO:
* Add use for "Intelligence" and other genes
* Add menu and ability to change starting settings
* Add chance for collision to cause circles to conjoin
    - Genes would have 50/50 chance of being in child's
* Add color or something to distinguish where circles came from similar to family tree
* Add more Mutation possibilities such as forgetting locations
* Add random spawning
* Make sure spawn does not already have a block of death/survival
* Add chance for going extinct and losing if dying before reproducing or something similar
* Add better random generation of landscape
* Make sure size doesn't affect death memory, Eg. Being smaller might allow movement through places where before would cause death
