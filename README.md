# evolution-AI
  I wanted to experiment with learning AI and made this little circle.

  Little circle begins as not very intelligent and moves randomly. Upon colliding with an object, it dies but creates
a new circle that is smarter and remembers what caused the previous death. With more deaths and more generations, it becomes
more intelligent and could prevent dying and reaching the end.
